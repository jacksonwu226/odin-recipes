    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Sweet, tangy, and refreshing fried chicken! This recipe will 
      guide you through each step to achieve that perfect balance of the 
      crispy batter, the juicy meat, and freshness of the lemon sauce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pro-tip: eat this fast! One, because the chicken is crunchiest when 
      it's fresh out of the wok. Two, because the plate will be empty, all 
      your tablemates licking their sticky lips, if you so much as blink.
    </p>

      <li>1 tsp corn oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare a lemon (1.00 whole) for garnish by cutting it into 8 wedges.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Cut the chicken breast (14 oz) into 4 large pieces for easy handling. Halve the thicker sections horizontally so they’re not as thick. Then cut each piece of chicken into thin strips.
        </p>
        <p>
          Place the sliced chicken into a medium-sized bowl and push it all to one side. On the other side of the bowl, add the marinade ingredients: salt (1 tsp), sugar (1 tsp), white pepper (0.25 tsp), cornstarch (1 tbsp), oyster sauce (1 tbsp) and water (1 tbsp). Mix the marinade together until it’s well-combined, then mix it with the chicken until each slice of chicken is well-coated.
        </p>
        <p>
          In another bowl, crack and beat the egg (1 whole). Pour half of it into the bowl of marinated chicken and mix well. Set aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In another bowl, crack and beat the egg (1 whole). Pour half of it into the bowl of marinated chicken and mix well. Set aside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Add sugar (4 tbsp), water (5 tbsp), and salt (0.25 tsp) to your freshly-squeezed lemon juice (2 oz). Mix well.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In a separate bowl, combine flour (9 tsp), cornstarch (2 tbsp), salt (0.50 tsp), and baking powder (1 tsp).
        </p>
        <p>
          Gradually add water (6 tbsp) 1 tbsp at a time and stir it in, until the batter has reached the desired consistency. You’re looking for the approximate consistency of pancake batter.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it runs quickly like water, it’s too thin; add more cornstarch (1 tbsp) and flour (2 tsp) as needed. If it falls slowly in heavy clumps, it’s too thick; add more water as needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Add oil (1 tsp) and the remaining half of beaten egg to the frying batter and mix well.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Add oil (12 oz) to the wok and turn the heat to high. While the oil is heating up, add the marinated chicken to the frying batter and mix thoroughly so every piece is coated. 
        </p>
        <p>
          When the oil reaches 325° F, turn the heat down to low. Piece by piece, lower the battered chicken into the oil. Split the chicken into two or more batches if necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turn the heat up to medium to bring the oil back up to temperature. Cook the chicken until you see the crust firm up and turn a pale yellow color, or about 3 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use a spider strainer or slotted spoon to scoop up the chicken and set aside in a clean bowl. Repeat with your subsequent batches until you’ve completed this first frying stage with all the chicken.
        </p>
        <p>
          Increase heat to high so the oil can reach 400° F.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just like the first fry, you may want to split the chicken into two or more batches. Once the oil is at 400° F, add the chicken. Cook until the crust is golden brown, about 20 seconds. Take the chicken out and set aside while you cook the sauce.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Prepare a cornstarch slurry by combining cornstarch (1.5 tsp) with water (1.5 tbsp). Mix well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pour the lemon juice mixture into a clean wok. Bring it to a boil over high heat.         
        </p>
        <p>
          When the juice comes to a boil, decrease the heat to low. Slowly pour in the cornstarch slurry while stirring constantly.   
        </p>
        <p>
          Turn the heat back up to high to thicken the sauce. Keep stirring so that lumps don’t form.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the consistency of the sauce is to your liking, add a dash of oil (1 tsp) and stir.
        </p>
        <p>
          Toss the fried chicken into the sauce and stir well until each piece is coated in that delicious, sticky sauce.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arrange lemon wedges in a tidy wreath around the edge of the plate. Transfer the luscious fried chicken to the middle of the plate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Garnish with a quick sprinkle of sesame seeds (1 dash).
        </p>
