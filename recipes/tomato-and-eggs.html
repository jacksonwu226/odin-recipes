  <h1>Tomato & Eggs</h1>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    This dish is a weeknight favorite! You won't believe how much flavor and texture you can create in 15 minutes. Honestly, maybe even 10 if you're super speedy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bonus: it requires the absolute bare minimum of ingredients. We don't even use garlic, or soy sauce, or oyster sauce. You can probably find every single one of these ingredients in any typical grocery store or supermarket. (If we can find a gas station that sells tomatoes... anyone up for a challenge?)  
  </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <h3>Main Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1.5 lb tomato</li>
    <li>4 egg</li>
    <li>5 slice ginger</li>
    <li>1 tbsp cornstarch (for slurry)</li>
    <li>4 tbsp water (for slurry)</li>
    <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
    <li>3 tbsp water</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Seasonings</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>0.50 tsb salt (for eggs)</li>
    <li>0.50 tsp salt (for stir-fry)</li>
    <li>2 tbsp brown sugar (for stir-fry)</li>
    <li>2 tbsp ketchup (for stiry-fry)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        This step is optional. You can leave the tomatoes unpeeled, peel just a few, or peel all of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Boil water, enough to later submerge the tomatoes. Shallowly score the tomatoes (1.5 lb) with an X, and place into a bowl. Pour the boiling water over the tomatoes, and let sit for about 2 minutes, or until the peel starts to curl out from the X.
      </p>
      <p>
        Carefully remove the tomatoes from the hot water, and use a knife to pull the peels away from the tomatoes.
      </p>
      <h4>Cut tomato</h4>
      <p>
        Cut each tomato in half and remove the hard bit at the stem. Cut each half further into 4 wedges.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Cut 5 thin slices of ginger (5 slice), and then julienne into thin strips.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Crack the eggs (4 ) into a large bowl. Season it with salt (0.50 tsp), and then beat vigorously until well combined.
    </li>
    <li>
      In a small bowl, mix together cornstarch (1 tbsp) and water (4 tbsp).
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Heat the pan on high heat. Add oil and give the pan a swirl to coat. Pour in the beaten eggs, and push the eggs gently around to scramble.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the eggs are about 80% cooked through, transfer them to a temporary plate or bowl.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The pan should still be hot, so add a bit more oil. Add the julienned ginger, then the tomato wedges. Stir-fry for about 30 seconds, then add water (3 tbsp).
      </p>
      <p>
        Season with salt (0.50 tsp) and brown sugar (2 tbsp). Keep the tomatoes cooking for about 2.5 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Give your cornstarch slurry a quick mix if it's settled, and then slowly pour it into the pan, mixing as you go. Depending on how thick you like the sauce, you may not need all of the slurry.
      </p>
      <h4>Add eggs & ketchup</h4>
      <p>
        Add the eggs back into the pan. Stir it in and let cook for 50 seconds, then turn off the heat. Add the ketchup (2 tbsp) and mix it in.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Give it a taste (but be careful, it's hot!) and adjust the seasoning if needed. Scoop or pour it out into a serving dish, and enjoy!
    </li>
